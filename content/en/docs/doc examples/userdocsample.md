# User Documentation

## What is user documentation?

User documentation, also known as end-user documentation, is any form of documentation intended for the end-user of a product or a service.

### User Documentation Example

#### Managing UserGroups

You can create usergroups to assign roles to access specific resources and applications to specific
users. You can assign these usergroups for users if you want to group users according to similar
assigned roles. In the Application bar UI, you can use the UAC (User Access Control) icon to create usergroups, copy usergroups, and edit usergroups.
