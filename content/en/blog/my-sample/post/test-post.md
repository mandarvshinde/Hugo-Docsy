The use of software development tools and procedures to produce technical documentation is known as "docs as code." It uses the same procedures and equipment as development teams, including issue trackers, automatic tests, and version control systems. It also depends on the creation and administration of small files. The use of documents as code is reasonably simple and accessible. The required equipment is basic, usually free, and as easy to use as text editors. The quickest method to get started with documents as code is to use lightweight formats like Markdown or AsciiDoc because they both let you work with plain text files.

Using doc-as-code tools encourages communication between developers and tech writers. You can use the same resources that developers use. Developers are involved in the creation of documentation. It lowers overall licensing and support service expenses.

The documentation is now added to the same repository as the code by developers, who no longer need to create it in a distinct system (using tools tied to writers). This guarantees that the documentation is accessible to anyone using the code. Engineers can view the documentation either in its original Markdown form or as it is displayed in a browser.

## What is a doc-as-code toolkit?

Involving developers in writing and editing documentation is an excellent practice that can help ensure that the documentation accurately reflects the technical details of the software being documented.
If you plan to involve developers in the documentation process, it makes sense to choose a tool or platform that supports a docs-as-code approach. This approach involves using tools and workflows that are familiar to developers, such as version control systems like Git and collaboration platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

Some popular tools for docs-as-code include Sphinx, Jekyll, and MkDocs, which allow you to write documentation in plain text using Markdown or reStructuredText and generate static HTML pages or other output formats automatically. These tools make it easy to manage documentation in a version-controlled environment, collaborate with other team members, and integrate documentation into your existing development workflows.

Overall, choosing a docs-as-code approach and tooling for documentation can help ensure that your documentation is accurate, up-to-date, and accessible.

## How can you create documentation websites using a docs-as-code toolkit?

To create documentation websites using a docs-as-code approach, you will need to follow these general steps:

1. **Choose a static site generator**: Static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, or Docusaurus are popular for creating documentation websites as they allow you to generate HTML files from Markdown, reStructuredText, or other plain-text formats. You can choose a generator that fits your needs and experience level.

2. **Write your documentation in plain text**: You can write your documentation in a plain-text format such as Markdown, reStructuredText, or AsciiDoc. These formats are easy to learn, and many developers are already familiar with them.

3. **Use a version control system**: You must use a version control system such as Git to manage your documentation files. This will allow you to track changes and collaborate with other contributors.

4. **Store your documentation alongside your code**: You can store your documentation alongside your code in the same repository or a separate one. This makes it easy to keep your documentation up-to-date and in sync with your code.

5. **Automate documentation builds**: You can use continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) tools like GitHub Actions or Travis CI to automate the build and deployment of your documentation site. This will allow you to automatically generate and publish your documentation whenever you make changes.

6. **Host your documentation site**: You can host your documentation site on a static website hosting services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or AWS S3. These services are easy to set up and provide a secure and reliable way to host documentation.

Overall, creating documentation websites using a docs-as-code approach involves using plain-text formats, version control, static site generators, and automation tools. By following these steps, you can create and maintain high-quality documentation that is easy to use and keeps up with changes to your code.
