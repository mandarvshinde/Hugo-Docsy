Lately, I have been obsessed with exploring free available open-source tools for building documentation websites, blogs, and static websites such with Hugo, Docusaurus, Jekyll, MkDocs, Antora, etc that can be deployed on platforms such as GitHub, Netlify, AWS, and Azure. I have only tried deploying a website on Netlify as this is one of the popular, easy-to-understand, simple deploying processes that is very easy for a less tech-enabled late-bloomer millennial like me.

## What are the two categories of websites?

The two categories of websites are:
* Dynamic Websites
* Static Websites

**Dynamic Websites** - What is a dynamic website? Consider a Facebook page. After logging in, you can see a list of friends online, some feeds from friends, pages you like, birthday alerts, and some feeds from friends. A different Facebook user will probably have an entirely different collection of online friends and receive different items in the news feed. This is a dynamic website as it is constantly changing and needs a database.

**Static Websites** - A static site, as the name suggests, is static i.e. its content does not change that frequently, and it does not need a database. Building a static website is easy compared to a dynamic website.

## Why build a static website using Hugo?

Building a simple static website is now quite simple and can sometimes be completed in just a few minutes or even seconds thanks to the abundance of tools available to web developers.
One such tool that makes creating a static website very easy is Hugo. Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun.

## How to create your own static website using Hugo?

You can follow the steps in the Quick Start section on Hugo's website to build your first static website.

## What knowledge you will need to build a website using Hugo?

If you want to build a static website using Hugo, you will need a rudimentary understanding of HTML and CSS, and markup language knowledge of Markdown.

### My Website Blog

Creating my website the way I wanted required some effort as I am not used to creating webpages in HTML and CSS. However, I am pleased with how the blog turned out and with what I learned along the way.
